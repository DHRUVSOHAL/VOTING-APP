This is a web-based online voting application where both the backend server and the MongoDB Atlas database are deployed online. The application starts from an index.html page that provides two options: Sign Up and Login. Existing users can log in using their Aadhaar card number and password, while new users can register themselves through the Sign Up option. After successful authentication, users are redirected to the home.html page, where access is controlled using a token-based authorization system that determines whether the user is an admin or a voter.

If the logged-in user is a voter, the application provides options such as viewing profile details, changing the password, casting a vote, and viewing voting records. Voters can select a candidate from the available list and submit their vote, which is then stored and reflected in the records section. If the logged-in user is an admin, the application allows full administrative control, including adding new candidates, deleting existing candidates, and updating candidate information. The entire system ensures secure role-based access, with the backend hosted on Render and the database managed using MongoDB Atlas.
